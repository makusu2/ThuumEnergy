	\begin{section}{Abstract}
		For our final project, we would like to calculate the most powerful Thu'um (dragon shout) in Skyrim. Thu'um are abilities, and can take many forms, including pushing an object away from you, breathing fire, or summoning an object. Each of these actions would take some amount of energy, and our goal is to figure out which Thu'um uses the most. We will have to approach each shout differently; for example, we would take data of falling objects to calculate g on Nirn (the planet on which the game takes place) and use that to contrast against the Unrelenting Force shout (the ability to push an object away), to figure out how much energy that uses. Our goal is to get a value for each shout and find the maximum.
